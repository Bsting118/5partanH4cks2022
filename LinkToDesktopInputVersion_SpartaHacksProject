Please copy and paste the link below to your web browser to test out and see the vision/rough draft of a 3D VR photo render game meant to aid mentally ill with memory problems by 
immersing them in a nostalgic, comfortable, and memorable 3D virtual environment that elevates off of a 2D digital photo. 

**NOTE: This is the version that includes the desktop functionality over the VR functionality, so no VR controllers or headset preview is available in this version.
Unity has some strange input variations between VR and normal 3D games so the push button GUI scene 1 would not work if VR control inputs were enabled.
To see the VR control inputs in action, please see the demo project V2 zip folder uploaded by my team member.**
